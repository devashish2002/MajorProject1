All major air purifiers available in the market
work on the principle of open loop system with heavily depending
on manual control. Moreover, they do not consider the changes in
ambient air quality which they are purifying. This paper presents
a new approach to monitor and collect the data via various
sensors which contribute in determining the quality of air and
simultaneously incorporating that data to be fed into the control
process of air purifier mechanism. In this way, manual control of
purifiers can be obviated and they can be made “smart” by
automatically determining the operating intensity by sensing the
surrounding air quality.
